function [m, A, Eigenfaces] = EigenfaceCore(T)
% Use Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the most  discriminating features between images of faces.
%
% Description: This function gets a 2D matrix, containing all training image vectors
% and returns 3 outputs which are extracted from training database.
%
% Argument:      T                      - A 2D matrix, containing all 1D image vectors.
%                                         Suppose all P images in the training database 
%                                         have the same size of MxN. So the length of 1D 
%                                         column vectors is M*N and 'T' will be a MNxP 2D matrix.
% 
% Returns:       m                      - (M*Nx1) Mean of the training database
%                Eigenfaces             - (M*Nx(P-1)) Eigen vectors of the covariance matrix of the training database
%                A                      - (M*NxP) Matrix of centered image vectors

% Align a set of face images (the training set T1, T2, ... , TM )
%
% Description: This function reshapes all 2D images of the training database
% into 1D column vectors. Then, it puts these 1D column vectors in a row to 
% construct 2D matrix 'T'.
%  
% 
% Argument:     TrainDatabasePath      - Path of the training database
%
% Returns:      T                      - A 2D matrix, containing all 1D image vectors.
%                                        Suppose all P images in the training database 
%                                        have the same size of MxN. So the length of 1D 
%                                        column vectors is MN and 'T' will be a MNxP 2D matrix.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Sorting and eliminating eigenvalues
% All eigenvalues of matrix L are sorted and those who are less than a
% specified threshold, are eliminated. So the number of non-zero
% eigenvectors may be less than (P-1).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Calculating the eigenvectors of covariance matrix 'C'
% Eigenvectors of covariance matrix C (or so-called "Eigenfaces")
% can be recovered from L's eiegnvectors.
